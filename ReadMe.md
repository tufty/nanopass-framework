Nanopass Compiler Library
==========================

This tar-ball contains an R6RS version of the Nanopass Compiler Infrastructure
described in \[1, 2\], along with the beginnings of a test compiler for the
library and the rough start to a users guide.

Files
======

    copyright.txt -- contains the original copyright file from Dipa Sarkar
    nanopass.ss   -- the main interface to the nanopass compiler library
    nanopass/     -- contains the parts that nanopass.ss aggregates from
    doc/          -- contains a user guide and developer guide along with
                     a makefile for generating their pdfs with pdflatex
    test-all.ss   -- is a simple wrapper for importing the compiler and
                     performing a testing run of all of the tests.
    tests/        -- contains a testing compiler along with tests for that
                     compiler and a driver for running the tests
    lib/          -- pre-compiled binaries for use with petite

For more information on using the pre-compile binaries, see the README.md file
in the `lib` directory.
